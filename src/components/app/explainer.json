{"html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.plurview.com/\">PLURview</a> uses color gradients to describe what sort of EDM show you can expect from an artist. The colors create a new visual language for describing music without relying on labels. With a general understanding of what the <strong>6 basic colors</strong> represent, you can tell at a glance whether an unknown artist is in your taste range.</p>\n<p>Some background on this: the PLURview database currently has <strong>243 subgenres of EDM</strong> associated with various artists. If these were split evenly for every artist in the database, <strong>each artist would have nearly 10 subgenres</strong> to describe their sound. <em>The system is broken</em>.</p>\n<h2>The PLURview Vibe System</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the answer to DJs&#8217; &#8220;Death to Genres!&#8221; battle cry: no more genres. Use vibes instead. Some shows will have more of a <strong>Deep House</strong> vibe to them. Sometimes they&#8217;ll get you bouncing with something more <strong>Big Room</strong>, drop after drop. The mosh pit at a <strong>Dubstep</strong> show is probably not the best place to make out with someone. You&#8217;ll often find dubstep mixed with <strong>Trap</strong> music, which has more hip-hop influences. If you want something more chill, go to a <strong>Trance</strong> show or get weird with some <strong>Bass Music</strong>.</p>\n<p>Most shows will be a blend of styles, although some artists can fit snugly into one vibe or another. Here&#8217;s the visual breakdown:</p>\n<h3>Red &#8211; Deep House</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-red-color-bar-house-1024x4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"80%\" height=\"3\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-278\" srcset=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-red-color-bar-house-1024x4.png 1024w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-red-color-bar-house-300x1.png 300w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-red-color-bar-house-768x3.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Carl Cox is one of the big names to think of when it comes to the red color bar.

The underlying algorithm sets a gradient based on numerous factors, in various weights. Some artists have a darker or lighter shade to them. They also vary in terms of more subdued or vibrant colors. No two artists are completely the same, and the gradient reflects the differences.</p>\n<p><em>High Energy Blend &#8211; Borgeous</em> <img src=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-high-energy-blend-color-bar-multivibe-300x1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"80%\" height=\"3\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-280\" srcset=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-high-energy-blend-color-bar-multivibe-300x1.png 300w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-high-energy-blend-color-bar-multivibe-768x3.png 768w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-high-energy-blend-color-bar-multivibe-1024x4.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eiFZdwiLyfA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Part Big Room/Part Trance &#8211; Gabriel &amp; Dresden</em> <img src=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-pink-to-blue-color-bar-chill-big-room-gabriel-dresden-300x1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"80%\" height=\"3\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-275\" srcset=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-pink-to-blue-color-bar-chill-big-room-gabriel-dresden-300x1.png 300w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-pink-to-blue-color-bar-chill-big-room-gabriel-dresden-768x3.png 768w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-pink-to-blue-color-bar-chill-big-room-gabriel-dresden-1024x4.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3wgYUDv0X4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>No two artists are alike, but you&#8217;ll find a lot of common combinations: yellow/green with dubstep and trap, red/pink is common with big room, as is red/blue with trance. As you become more comfortable with the color scheme, the hope with <a href=\"https://www.plurview.com/\">PLURview</a> is to give you an effective shorthand to see if an artist is worth your time to explore.</p>\n<p>The algorithm is by no means perfect or complete. This project is still in its infancy. Many artists in the database have too few data points to produce a reasonably accurate gradient. For those, you&#8217;ll find the neutral gradient below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-neutral-color-bar-300x1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"80%\" height=\"3\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-273\" srcset=\"http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-neutral-color-bar-300x1.png 300w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-neutral-color-bar-768x3.png 768w, http://nephewapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plurview-visual-language-neutral-color-bar-1024x4.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n"}
